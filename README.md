# ToDiane.dev

This is a two-page website created to document my journey towards becoming a **Full Stack Developer** with Code Institute. I registered in the last week of April 2023 and began looking at the course material from the first week in May.

I have experience with WordPress so I am familiar with html and CSS but have never used or tried to learn javascript, python and other languages. While I am not new to css I haven't really had to use it very much because WordPress templates come ready made and I only had to make changes to a template. This is the second website I have built from scratch using html and css. The first one being my first portfolio project The Sologamy Club - live link <https://todiane.github.io/sologamyp1/>


As my skills in javascript and/or python improve I will make changes to the website. 


## External blog.

I will be updating the website along with the WordPress blog I set up using the domain todiane.dev
