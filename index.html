        <h2>Digital Trailblazer Since 2007</h2>
        <p>
          I'm part of the GenX generation that grew up alongside the internet. We didn't just witness the digital revolution—we built it. At 58, I recognize that my age and experience are my greatest assets in this field:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>2007-2010:</strong> Founded and ran Women Internet Marketers, bringing together women from the USA, UK, and other countries interested in internet marketing, complete with a podcast before podcasting was mainstream.</li>
          <li><strong>2009:</strong> Created Dominican Diaspora, a membership site that grew to over 8,000 members and was eventually sold—proving the power of community building in the early social web days.</li>
          <li><strong>2011-2015:</strong> Launched Influencers.biz—a WordPress multisite platform long before "influencer" became a buzzword—helping local businesses enhance their online presence through collective blogging and SEO.</li>
          <li><strong>2011-2017:</strong> Operated Little Fish Digital Media, assisting local business owners with SEO and client acquisition strategies.</li>
          <li><strong>2011-2012:</strong> Served as membership manager for Blog Success, providing support and guidance to members navigating the then-emerging blogosphere.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          I've been invited to speak at the University of the West Indies, teaching authors how to leverage the internet to promote their work—sharing knowledge when digital marketing was still in its infancy.
        </p>
<br>
        <h2>Knowledge Sharer</h2>
        <p>
          Throughout my journey, I've created countless free PDFs on blogging and podcasting, run workshops to help others master digital tools, and continuously prioritized education over profit. This commitment to sharing knowledge stems from my belief that digital success shouldn't be gatekept.
          I've built connections not through manufactured personas or trendy gimmicks, but through genuine expertise and relatable experiences. I don't hide my GenX identity—I wear my technological scars with pride. I've coded in languages no longer spoken, built websites before frameworks existed, and navigated countless technological shifts.
        </p>
        <p>
          I love learning and am currently expanding my skills with FastAPI and NextJS. My tech stack—Django, Python, Tailwind CSS—continues to grow because I understand that in this field, evolution isn't optional.
        </p>

        <h2>Experience as Currency</h2>
        <p>
          In the digital age, where trends come and go overnight, experience remains the ultimate currency. The systems I build are informed by decades of watching technology evolve, fail, succeed, and transform. This isn't just a career I stumbled into—it's the culmination of a lifetime spent adapting to technological change.
        </p>

        <h2>What This Means For Your Business</h2>
        <p>
          My unique blend of traits and experience translates into tangible benefits for your organization:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Strategic Focus Without the Ego</strong> - You get a developer who puts your business goals first, not someone seeking personal validation or trying to impress with unnecessary complexity.</li>
          <li><strong>Deep Work Over Constant Communication</strong> - My introvert nature means I deliver thoughtful, high-quality solutions rather than filling your inbox with updates about updates.</li>
          <li><strong>Decades of Pattern Recognition</strong> - Having witnessed countless digital trends come and go, I can quickly identify what will actually work for your business versus fleeting fads that waste resources.</li>
          <li><strong>Human-Centered Problem Solving</strong> - My focus on meaningful connection means I build solutions that resonate with your actual users, not just solutions that look good in a portfolio.</li>
          <li><strong>Genuine Long-Term Investment</strong> - My natural tendency to go above and beyond means I genuinely care about the success of your projects long after the contract ends.</li>
          <li><strong>Adaptability Without Drama</strong> - When technical challenges arise (and they always do), you get calm, strategic solutions rather than panic or excuses.</li>
          <li><strong>Accelerated Learning Curve</strong> - My continuous self-improvement means you don't pay for my learning process—I come ready with the skills and adapt quickly to your specific needs.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Hiring me means getting a quiet partner who delivers powerful results—someone who puts your business success above personal visibility, and who brings decades of digital wisdom to every line of code.
        </p>
