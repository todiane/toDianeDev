                <p>I am self-employed and use my skills to build WordPress websites which provide passive income through affiliate
                    payments, self-publishing and print-on-demand. I also earn an income through tutoring and 
                    building WordPress websites for others. In my time online I have started and run an 8,000+ member 
                    strong  membership site called Dominican Diaspora using the Ning platform. 
                 Taken on freelance work like Membership Manager of an American based learning platform called Blog Success. 
                 Run my own business providing local marketing services to local business owners. 
                 Created and run workshops on blogging and using WordPress for small business owners. My main focus now is print-on-demand 
                 and publishing low-content books via Amazon.

                area. This website has been created to highlight my projects and will change as my knowledge and skills grow.

                <p>I took part in my first hackathon in June 2023 to celebrate the month of PRIDE. Our project 
                    focused on the LGBTQ+ community.  I put forward the team name Our P.R.I.D.E. (partnership, renders, incredible
                    developer energy) which everyone was happy to accept. </p><p>We created a tool that checks for non-inclusive language and provides a more
                    inclusive alternative. Our PRIDE won second place <i class="fas fa-award"></i>. Our team presentation starts at 3:47 in the video.
