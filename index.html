                <p>I am self-employed and use my skills to build WordPress websites which provide passive income through affiliate
                    payments, self-publishing and print-on-demand. I also earn an income through tutoring and 
                    building WordPress websites for others. In my time online I started and ran a 
                    membership site with over 8,000+ members called Dominican Diaspora, using the Ning platform. 
                 Worked freelance as Membership Manager of an American based learning platform called Blog Success. 
                 Run my own business providing local marketing services to local business owners. 
                 Ran workshops on blogging and using WordPress for small business owners. My main focus now is print-on-demand 
                 and publishing low-content books via Amazon.
